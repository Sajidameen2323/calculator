            <p style="word-wrap: break-word;">The history of medicine shows how societies have changed in their approach 
              to illness and disease from ancient times to the present. Early medical traditions include those of Babylon, 
              China, Egypt and India. Sushruta, from India, introduced the concepts of medical diagnosis and prognosis.
              The Hippocratic Oath was written in ancient Greece in the 5th century BCE, and is a direct inspiration 
              for oaths of office that physicians swear upon entry into the profession today. In the Middle Ages,
               surgical practices inherited from the ancient masters were improved and then systematized in Rogerius's
                The Practice of Surgery. Universities began systematic training of physicians around 1220 CE in Italy.</p>

            <p>According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, mental health refers to a person’s
              emotional, social, and psychological well-being. Mental health is as important as physical health as part
              of a full, active lifestyle.

              It is harder to define mental health than physical health because many psychological diagnoses depend on
              an individual’s perception of their experience.

              With improvements in testing, however, doctors are now able to identify some physical signs of some types
              of mental illness in CT scans and genetic tests.

              Good mental health is not only categorized by the absence of depression, anxiety, or another disorder. It
